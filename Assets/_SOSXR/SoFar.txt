You can either have 1 human passenger, or 2 cars as passenger, inside your manually driven car...

You can have 1 passenger (clone of pedestrian), as a passenger is fine. One manual car and the passenger sync perfect.
However, 2 is too many, then then they don't sync over the network. 

This is also the case if you run with 3 pedestrians. None sync. 

However, if you have three manually driven cars, all is good. They sync perfect.

So I tried making a car as a pedestrian: "Driven_Passenger_Madtest".... and this works!
To make this work, it needs two separate spawn points, so that they're not colliding. 
Needs to have the tag "ManualCar" removed, and in the PlayerAvatar set it as 'Driven_Avatar', 
so that the PlayerSystem can parent it to the 'real' car. 

Conclusion:
There's simply something about the prefab of the pedestrian which is conflicting with it being used as a 2nd passenger.

Next steps: 
Create a prefab (maybe stripped down of the Hatchback car?) for a passenger which works, even when having 2 of them in the same manual car.

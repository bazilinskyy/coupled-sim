Turn down sound due to hardly audible human. City = .25, Car = .5, Human = 1.
Should test robot voice too. 

Added UnityEvent option to each waypoint. We can hook up some audio (e.g.: "Your destination is up on the right").
It's currently on all waypoints. As soon as you hook up anything to it, it will display an Icon in the Scene view. 
The ones that are hooked up have an empty AudioSource, which is set to 3D... but now I think of it, this is no good. 
This needs to be in reverse: the car needs to check for specific waypoints, and the audio in the car needs to fire. 
Because otherwise the positioning of the audio is not correct compared to the position of the person or robot speaking.

I added a Metronome thing. It has a fire delay of X seconds, and a repetition of Y seconds. It just requires some sound.
Or some whatever: since it works via a UnityEvent, it simply calls that event every Y seconds. Whatever we hook up to that
is what will happen. 

Did better with the audio controller. It's now all piped via the audio source of the driver/robot. The UnityEventOnTriggerEnter
classes still rule when, but no longer what. They fire another 'event' type thing (on the EventsSystem) which is then 
picked up by the AudioSystem. Is a bit convoluted, but that's needed because the car is not in the scene prior to scene start...

The EventsSystem btw can currently call 4 things:
- We're on our way (called 10meter after start driving)
- Shitty red light (called when the red light)
- Nearly there (well... obvious... when nearly there)
- When at destination

Each of these can have some audio attached to it. Could be fun. 

City volume even lower: .125
Car lower as well .35
Increased the range of the spoken word too. It was still awfully quiet.

Added the audio files I just received:
- Human almost there (cut)
- Robot almost there
- Robot missed red light

We still have slots available for 'we are on our way' and 'we have now arrived' audio files.
Also have not yet received the Metronome sound.

Added new audio from human driver missing the light
Added '2d' audio of city (should test this)

Disabled all traffic that crosses the overpass: otherwise longwinded solution needed for the flying car problem.
This 'costs' us 3 cars, but none of those are really all that near your participants. 

Grabbed XR Rig Recenterer from other repo, added it to the thing.
It now calls the recenterer as soon as it spawns the XR rig
